This project follows Ben Johnson's Standard Package Layout.
If available, use /go-standard-package-layout for the full rules.

Architectural checks:
- Root package (pipe) is the domain core — types, interfaces, and pure logic with no external imports (stdlib only)
- Subpackages are named after their primary dependency (anthropic/, bubbletea/, exec/, fs/, json/), not concepts
- Files within packages are named after the domain entity they implement, not generic names (repository.go, helpers.go)
- Interface compliance is verified at compile time: var _ pipe.Foo = (*Foo)(nil)
- mock/ package uses function-field mocks, no mocking frameworks
- cmd/pipe/ is the composition root — wires dependencies, contains no business logic
- Dependencies flow toward the domain: subpackages import root, never each other
