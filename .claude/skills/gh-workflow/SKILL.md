# GitHub Workflow Skill

## Issue Creation Template (MANDATORY)

Every issue created must follow this structure:

### Context
Describe WHAT the issue is about and WHY it matters. Never describe HOW to implement it.

### Investigation Starting Points
- File/code references that are relevant
- Specific functions, modules, or tests to look at

### Scope Constraints
- What is explicitly NOT in scope
- Boundaries to prevent scope creep

### Validation
- Testable acceptance criteria
- How to verify the issue is resolved

---

## Organization with Milestones

Issues within a milestone are executed sequentially by issue number (ascending).
Order matters - create issues in the sequence they should be implemented.

```bash
# Create milestone
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones -f title="v0.1" -f description="..."

# List milestones
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones --jq '.[] | "\(.title) (\(.open_issues) open)"'

# Create issue in milestone
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --milestone "v0.1"

# List issues in milestone (execution order)
gh issue list --milestone "v0.1" --state open --json number,title --jq 'sort_by(.number)'
```

---

## Core Issue Commands

```bash
# List issues
gh issue list
gh issue list --milestone "v0.1"
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels

# View issue (always include --comments for context)
gh issue view <number> --comments

# Create issue
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "..." --milestone "..."

# Edit issue
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..." --milestone "..."

# Close issue
gh issue close <number>
```

---

## PR Commands

```bash
# Create PR
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# View PR with comments
gh pr view <number> --comments

# Merge PR
gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch

# Add general comment to PR
gh pr comment <number> --body "..."

# Reply to a specific review comment (inline code comment)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/comments -f body="..." -F in_reply_to=<comment_id>

# List review comments to find comment IDs
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/comments
```
